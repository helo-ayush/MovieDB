# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - TMDB Integration

## Step 1: Get Your TMDB API Key

1. Go to [TMDB Website](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to [API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
4. Request an API key (it's completely free!)

## Step 2: Add Your API Key

Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real API key!**

## Step 3: Start Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see real movies! ðŸŽ¬

## Troubleshooting

**If you see "TMDB API key is not configured":**
